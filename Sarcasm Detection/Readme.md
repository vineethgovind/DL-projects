Sarcasm Detection: Past studies in Sarcasm Detection mostly make use of Twitter datasets collected using hashtag basedsupervision but such datasets are noisy in terms of labels and language. Furthermore, many tweets arereplies to other tweets and detecting sarcasm in these requires the availability of contextual tweets.In this hands-on project, the goal is to build a model to detect whether a sentence is sarcastic or not, usingBidirectional LSTMs.DatasetNews Headlines dataset for Sarcasm DetectionThe dataset is collected from two news websites, theonion.com and huffingtonpost.comThis new dataset has the following advantages over the existing Twitter datasets:Since news headlines are written by professionals in a formal manner, there are no spelling mistakes andinformal usage. This reduces the sparsity and also increases the chance of finding pre-trained embeddings.Furthermore, since the sole purpose of TheOnion is to publish sarcastic news, we get high-quality labels withmuch less noise as compared to Twitter datasets.Unlike tweets that reply to other tweets, the news headlines obtained are self-contained. This would help us inteasing apart the real sarcastic elementsContentEach record consists of three attributes:-is_sarcastic: 1 if the record is sarcastic otherwise 0-headline: the headline of the news article-article_link: link to the original news article.
