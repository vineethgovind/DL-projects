It is often used to help disambiguate natural language phrases because it can be done quickly with high accuracy. Tagging can be used for many NLP tasks like determining correct pronunciation during speech synthesis (for example, _dis_-count as a noun vs dis-_count_ as a verb), for information retrieval, and for word sense disambiguation.\n","\n","In this notebook, you'll use the [Pomegranate](http://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/) library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging using a \"universal\" tagset. Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve [>96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~thorsten/publications/Brants-ANLP00.pdf). Hidden Markov models have also been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more. \n","\n","![](_post-hmm.png)\n","\n","The notebook already contains some code to get you started.

The data sparsity problem arises because the same amount of data split over more tags means there will be fewer samples in each tag, and there will be more missing data  tags that have zero occurrences in the data. The techniques in this section are optional.\n","\n","- [Laplace Smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing) (pseudocounts)\n","    Laplace smoothing is a technique where you add a small, non-zero value to all observed counts to offset for unobserved values.\n","\n","- Backoff Smoothing\n","    Another smoothing technique is to interpolate between n-grams for missing data. This method is more effective than Laplace smoothing at combatting the data sparsity problem.

Altering your HMM to achieve the same performance would require implementing deleted interpolation (described in the paper), incorporating trigram probabilities in your frequency tables, and re-implementing the Viterbi algorithm to consider three consecutive states instead of two.\n","\n","### Obtain the Brown Corpus with a Larger Tagset\n","Run the code below to download a copy of the brown corpus with the full NLTK tagset.
