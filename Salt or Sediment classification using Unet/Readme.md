Implement U-Net neural model architecture
In this, you are asked to segment salt deposits beneath the Earthâ€™s surface. Given a set of seismic images that are 101 x 101 pixels each and each pixel we need to classify as either salt or sediment. Our goal is to segment regions that contain salt. A seismic image is produced from imaging the reflection coming from rock boundaries. The seismic image shows the boundaries between different rock types.
